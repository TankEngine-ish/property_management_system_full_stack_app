# Project Overview 
This is my now second full-stack application. I used Go, Typescript with Next.js, little bit of tailwind, PostgreSQL and my favorite Docker Compose.

The reason why I did this is because our property manager needed assistance collecting fees for building repairs
and I've decided to use the opportunity to create a coding project to keep track of who's paying.

The application follows a three-tier architecture pattern (some would say it's even implementing a microservice approach but I wouldn't agree) with these key components:

* Backend Service in Go: RESTful API for data operations
* Frontend Service (Next.js): User interface with React components
* Database (PostgreSQL): Persistent data storage
* CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins): Automated testing and deployment
* Observability Stack: Monitoring and logging

For the backend I tried to use modular structure as much as possible.
I have defined plenty of constants to avoid hardcoding values, which is a good practice for maintainability. I gotta mention this even though it would come later in my documentation that some of the code edits I did were a result of *Sonarqube*:

Above is a sample screenshot of some of the advice their platform gave me after I implemented its functionality in my Jenkins pipeline. It's pretty neat if you get tired of your preferred AI agent's suggestions. So what I've changed because of Sonar is I constructed HTTP Header Constants, Error Message Constants and a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) Type Constant.


### The main function flow:

* Environment loading with godotenv
* Database connection and setup
* Router configuration
* API endpoint registration
* CORS middleware implementation
* Server startup


### API Endpoints:

* /health: Health check endpoint (The main reason I wanted to add this is because I wanted the backend to be as much Kubernetes-ready as possible)
* /api/repair/users: GET (all users) and POST (create user)
* /api/repair/users/{id}: GET, PUT, DELETE operations for specific users. Far from perfect but will come back and make it more modular after some time.


### Middleware:

* CORS enablement
* JSON content type setting

It's all far from production ready but I wanted to really focus on the infrastructure components later in another repository.

# The Continuos Integration Map of my Application

Below is a Figma diagram I made to illustrate all the bits and pieces that came into play on the surface level.

# It All Started With Jenkins

As I was building my initial version of the pipeline I wanted to implement a secondary branch where the hypothetical dev, ops and QA teams can build and test new features and debug. I also wanted to create for them a nice pipeline to do so. Well, but because GitHub can only send webhook payloads to a publicly accessible URL, like I needed to set-up:

* A fixed local IP via DHCP reservation, so my router always knew where Jenkins lived.
* Port forwarding from your router (ports 80 and 443) to your Jenkins machine.
* DuckDNS domain to point to my homeâ€™s dynamic public IP.
* Nginx reverse proxy to serve Jenkins at that domain with SSL.
* Let's Encrypt / Certbot to generate valid HTTPS certs (GitHub requires HTTPS for webhooks).


### My goal was to create a smooth workflow like:

- Devs push code to GitHub.
- GitHub sends a webhook to Jenkins.
- Jenkins triggers my CI/CD pipeline (test, build, push Docker images, etc.).
- I get feedback in Jenkins and/or GitHub status checks.

My very last version of my Jenkins pipeline looked like this:

- I have implemeneted parameters and environment variables to make the pipeline flexible and reduce hardcoded values.

- I leveraged Jenkins credentials binding for secure access to sensitive data (Docker tokens, GitHub API tokens) to adhere to security best practices.

- I managed to Running unit tests concurrently for both frontend and backend to minimize build time and improve efficiency. I had some issues with setting up the Cypress E2E test in headless mode as Jenkins runs are obviously a non GUI environment but I am so proud that I managed to crack it!
Below is a screenshot of a local cypress run test I did in the beginning:

- The dynamic tagging of Docker images using parameterized version numbers ensures consistent and reproducible builds.This is me adding parameters for the builds if one day I decide to scrap the automatic run on push to feature approach:

![alt text](<assets/Screenshot from 2025-03-18 19-48-19.png>)

- What my pipeline also does is it manages infrastructure changes it automates PR creation by creating a pull request to update the infrastructure repository. This way I ensure that changes are reviewed and merged through a controlled process.

- Dynamic Branch and PR Naming: Functions that generate branch names and PR titles based on updated components improve clarity and traceability.

- And finally I have the integrated code quality checks:

- At the end I ensure that the workspace is cleaned up after each build and provides clear feedback on the build status.

- I really also wanted to mention that I have also integrated my pipeline with a *Sonatype Nexus Repository*

It is really worth mentioning that my build time got reduced by about 20-25 seconds for such a small application like mine compared to pushing to docker hub. Imagine that on scale? But because I later implemented ArgoCD it was far easier for me to switch to dockerHub because I think I had to set-up Image Updater but I am not quite sure yet how or if I even needed to do that. Anyway, it's very much worth sharing that with you.





# Brief Demo









Problems I fixed:

I mounted the .env file in the docker compose file. 
Then i removed the cached postgres db and restarted the docker images.
Now it was able to reconnect.


Also pushing to docker hub with re-tagging an image.
Useful commands "docker images" and "docker tag d4332ddfd789 tankengine/goapp:latest" and then push with "docker push tankengine/goapp:latest"


Jenkins part:

I've decided to use a local installation of Jenkins instead of having it as container and mindlessly fiddling with docker groups, Docker-IN-Docker images, sockets
and user permissions.
I added the jenkins user to the docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins and did a test script:

Started by user jenkins
[Pipeline] Start of Pipeline
[Pipeline] node
Running on Jenkins in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/docker test
[Pipeline] {
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Docker Test)
[Pipeline] script
[Pipeline] {
[Pipeline] sh
+ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // script
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS


fixed an issue where babel was interfering with the nextjs engine when building the docker compose so I had to tinker with the babelrc config file.
Now the jest test works and the compose works as well.

did the jest db, frontend and backend tests. Did the E2E test.

Created credentials for the dockerhub account inside Jenkins.

Set up Cypress in the headless environment in Jenkins.rm -rf cypress.
Installed the xvfb dependency. Config the file for no support file.

I did a DHCP reservation for a local static IP so I can host my jenkins on an nginx server
in order to expose it to GItHub's webhook so I can build on push to the repo.

I forwarded requests on port 80 and port 443 from my public IP to port 80 and 443 on my local Ubuntu server.

Nexus:

I had to create an npmrc file which is a configuration file used by the npm(Node Package Manager) command-line tool. It allows you to customize various settings related to how npm behaves while managing packages and dependencies for your Node.

The commands below fixed the issue of not uploading my npm dependencies to Nexus: 

npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install


I managed to reduce the build time from more than 2 minutes to a whopping 17 seconds!!!

Sonarqube: 

It requires postgres so I integrated its docker image with my already existing postgres image.
Because I don't use maven or gradle I am using sonarscanner.

thing I learned - always restart the container after setting up in order to see if it really persist data.
SO I did a separate postgres database to store the logs of sonarqube there.

I moved to another linux machine...



Infra and k8s stuff: 

1. I had to make an S3 bucket for the Terraform state. I'm utilizing Terraform's best practices by using Remote State.
2. But before all that I created a user from the IAM so I won't be using my AWS root user. Then I created the EC2 instance via my TF configuration.
3. I created a separate providers.tf file and terraform.tf file following best practices.
